I absolutely see what you’re saying, and I want to help clarify what happened regarding orders 9769-213159-3775 and 9761-454605-5843. Here’s what occurred: Initially, a refund request was processed for both orders, but it was mistakenly initiated for the full amounts. Since this wasn’t the correct approach, I requested that those refund requests be canceled. That’s why you may have seen them reflected temporarily in your ""Pending Balance"" — but after cancellation, it was as if the original refund request had never happened. After canceling the full refund requests, I proceeded to process partial refunds for the correct amounts: -Order 9769-213159-3775: $350.00 -Order 9761-454605-5843: $39.00 To help visualize everything clearly, I’ve attached an image below showing the transactions between April 25, 2025, and April 26, 2025 (up to 7:52 AM). You’ll notice that your balance before the first transaction on the 25th was -$1,022.13 (highlighted in green). On the column labeled ""Ending Balance,"" you can follow your balance after each transaction. If it helps, I can also send you the full file with all the transaction details — just let me know, and I’ll get it over to you! I completely understand how confusing and frustrating these kinds of situations can be, especially with the additional movement through Pending and Available balances. Please feel free to reach out if you would like me to walk through the numbers with you further — I’m happy to go line-by-line if it helps ensure full clarity! 🌟 Thank you again for your patience, your partnership, and for being a valued part of the Palmstreet community.

You are referring to orders 9761-454605-5843 and 9769-213159-3775, which were partially refunded, but you noticed that your profit was decreased twice, correct? We reviewed your cashflow and found only one deduction recorded. Here is a more detailed explanation: 9761-454605-5843 9769-213159-3775 The refunds for these two orders occurred on April 26, 2025. Before the refunds, your balance was -1247.05, which matches your description. After the refunds, your profit was deducted by 357.93, and your balance became -1604.98, which also matches your expectations. Currently, however, your balance is -1999.9, which does not match your expectations, with a difference of 394.92. This difference was caused by the refunds of the following three orders: 9761-326525-9489 9760-872617-2557 9769-753523-9061 You can view more detailed information through this Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPFS2xZxiNW9lSjMauCYo-JxRuGfTNhaurwabgQeVnQ/edit?usp=sharing",4430490665,MESG,sendbird_group_channel_215482988_4fa48b03f2e105de0efece9e79f6b6a982c07614,,customer_service

At this point I need to force my team to unpack 30+ orders because they have been in a boxes since yesterday and I still can’t buy shipping labels.

We received a huge financial set back with UPS SURCHARGES which led to a huge delay in our operations. Right now, we’re asking for the opportunity to move forward with a clear plan to stabilize and resume full operations. Since our access to funds was disabled, we’ve continued fulfilling orders using the supplies and resources we already had on hand. However, we are currently operating at a $3,500 negative balance due to a wave of cancellations — many of which happened simply because we couldn’t give customers reliable shipping expectations without knowing when we’d receive our payout. We also have $5,000 in pending funds that are vital to covering our operational costs: shipping materials, staffing, and order prep. We’ve taken immediate steps to reduce new order intake while prioritizing the fulfillment of all open orders. We’ve tightened internal systems, reinforced inventory controls, and have made it a point to remain transparent and communicative with our customers during this entire situation. Our packing team is fully functional and ready to move forward. The infrastructure is already in place — we just need access to the funds we’ve already earned. Palmstreet has built its brand around supporting small businesses like mine. We’re not asking for sympathy — we’re showing you that we’re already doing the hard work to stay accountable and protect our reputation, and yours. We’re ready to continue operating responsibly, and we’re asking for the opportunity to do so. If there’s any information or documentation you need from me to move this forward, I’m more than willing to provide it.

I can’t even count how many cancellations and refunds to orders I could have fulfilled if not placed under these restrictions which was done without any notice. I have not been able to provide for my family, which frankly seems to only be a concern to me. I am being constantly asked to continue our shop without any access to our funds. Along with being bounced around every time I ask for a direct communication. I have been pleading the case for my shop for 26 days . I’m sure you have all been made aware of the big red flag above my business. I could have fulfilled all my orders. Palmstreet is making it very difficult borderline impossible to fulfill our orders with no payment timeline. We were originally warned to clean up the back log or we risked losing early payout. We followed through and began reviewing all current orders, in transit and label created. We have worked with Palmstreet support to correct all incorrect tracking numbers and orders that remained open due to incorrect trackings input on the system. Followed by shipping orders and and having those funds payout reversed. All payments disable with the condition to continue to ship and fulfill orders in a timely manner. Followed by thousands of dollars of orders cancelled and refunds because without access to funds we cannot operate our business properly. I cannot even count how many of my customers were affected by this. Yet I cannot tell them we have their plants but Palmstreet is withholding funds so we cannot ship the product. We cannot be expected sell and ship without any payment plan for 26 days. My customers are my priority and this has cause in reconcilable damages already to our shop. Every cancelled order and refund that has been caused because our shop was unable to resume operations. My team has been sent home for 26 days. We would like fulfill orders so we can make our customers happy. I have always been so proud to be apart of Palmstreet.

We understand the challenges that come with a larger customer base, especially when it leads to increased replacement requests or complications with out-of-stock items. Your question about the meaning of “all sales are final” from Palmstreet’s perspective is absolutely valid—we’re currently reviewing this internally to ensure clarity and consistency for both sellers and customers. We’ll follow up with more detail on that soon. In the meantime, we’d like to gently highlight that while offering replacements and timely support is highly appreciated, shipping consistency remains essential to the buyer experience. To maintain service quality across the platform, we encourage all sellers to stay within the committed shipping window as much as possible, ideally shipping orders within the promised timeframe (e.g., 7 days as you mentioned). This helps avoid confusion, reduces the need for buyer follow-ups, and reinforces trust—especially among first-time customers.

To clarify — when a seller exits the Foundation Program, there’s a standard 3-month probationary period before they’re eligible to be considered for reinstatement. After that period, sellers may reapply, but rejoining isn’t automatic and is subject to review. Also, just as a note: participation in the Foundation Program does not guarantee automatic payouts. Payout timing is based on account activity, order history, and compliance checks.

After reviewing your account, we can confirm that you are still in the Foundation Program at Tier 3. You were not removed from the program, and your current seller plan and benefits reflect that standing. That said, while you’re no longer under manual review for payouts, the early payout feature from your previous Foundation status is not currently re-enabled. If you ever find yourself needing funds sooner, you’re absolutely welcome to use the Overdraft feature available in the app. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any other questions — we’re happy to clarify anything further and are always here to support you.

Here’s a brief overview to help clarify things: Overdraft Feature This allows eligible sellers to access a Smart Limit (typically $500 for Foundation sellers) to help with things like label purchases or refunds when your current balance is low. You can manage participation in this feature directly through your account settings. If it’s ever disabled, it remains inactive until re-enabled by our team. Early Payout This feature gives sellers early access to their funds after a short hold period. While it’s not currently active on your account, it may be reevaluated in the future. If there are any changes or reactivations, we’ll be sure to notify you. Please feel free to reach out with any other questions — always happy to assist!
